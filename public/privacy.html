    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This website, mitaoe-notes.vercel.app (the "Site"), is an educational resource that makes notes stored on the site owner's Google Drive publicly available to users in a more accessible way. The Site does not require user login or authentication and is designed solely as a public educational resource for MITAOE students.</p>
        
        <p>This Site is open source, with code available at <a href="https://github.com/mitaoe/notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/mitaoe/notes</a>. Anyone is free to look into the codebase and contribute to its development.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The Site does not collect any personal information from its visitors. No user account creation or login is required to access the content.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Vercel Analytics to collect anonymous usage data for the sole purpose of understanding how the Site is used, ensuring it runs as expected, and identifying trends in user behavior. This data cannot be used to identify individual users and is only used to improve the Site's performance and user experience.</p>

        <h2>Content Source and Google API Usage</h2>
        <p>The content displayed on the Site is sourced from the Google Drive account of the Site owner (Developer Contact: sakshijoshi808@gmail.com). The owner uploads and organizes this content within their Google Drive specifically for the purpose of sharing it via this Site. The Site then acts as a public viewer for this designated educational content.</p>
        
        <p>To achieve this, the Site exclusively utilizes the Google Drive API. It is authorized by the site owner using a single OAuth scope: <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive</code> (often referred to by its shorthand <code>../auth/drive</code>). This scope grants the application comprehensive access necessary to interact with files and folders within the entirety of the owner's connected Google Drive account. While the scope itself provides broad access, the application's logic is specifically designed and strictly intended to perform only the following actions:
            <ol>
                <li>Read, list, and display only those educational files and their folder structures that the owner has organized within their Google Drive for public viewing on this Site.</li>
                <li>Temporarily modify sharing permissions on specific files (making them publicly readable) when a user initiates a download, to generate a publicly accessible download link. The application does not alter the content of the files themselves, nor does it delete any files.</li>
            </ol>
        The use of this comprehensive Google Drive API scope is essential for the application to effectively browse the owner's Drive structure to locate the intended notes and to manage sharing permissions for the download functionality. Access to the owner's Google Drive is managed securely via OAuth tokens. The application employs this access with utmost care and strictly for the stated educational purposes of making the owner's selected notes publicly available. The open-source nature of the Site (code available at <a href="https://github.com/mitaoe/notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/mitaoe/notes</a>) allows for full transparency in how the Google Drive API and the associated scope are used to interact with the owner's data. No other Google APIs or scopes are used by this application.
